# **South African Elections 2024 Data Analysis**
A data analysis project that transforms raw IEC (Independent Electoral Commission) election data into structured insights using Python, SQL, MS Access, and Power BI.
### The goal of this project was to visualize the 2024 national election data and conduct exploratory data analysis (EDA) to uncover trends, patterns, and insights.

## Tech Stack

- **Python**: Data cleaning and transformation
- **SQL**: Data structuring and querying
- **Power BI**: Data visualization and analysis
- **MS Access**: Database management
  
## Dataset Structure
I downloaded the (.CSV) file from the official IEC election results portal [IEC](https://results.elections.org.za/home/Downloads/NPE-Results) I then created an MS acces database consisting of Province, Municipality, VDistrict (Voting Districts), EResult (Election Results), PParty (Political Parties), PVotes (Party Votes)

## Exploratory Analysis

- Among overseas voters, the DA received a substantial **75.33%** of the votes, with the EFF following at **4.40%** and the ANC at **3.92%**.
- Excluding votes from KwaZulu-Natal, the ANC would still not have achieved a majority, securing only **46.49%** of the vote.
- Gauteng emerged as the most competitive province, with at least four political parties each receiving over **100,000** votes.
