# **South African Elections 2024 Data Analysis**

### Project Overview
The goal of this project was to visualize the 2024 national election data and conduct exploratory data analysis (EDA) to uncover trends, patterns, and insights. This analysis transforms raw IEC (Independent Electoral Commission) election data into structured insights using Python, SQL, MS Access, and Power BI.

## Tech Stack

- **Python**: Data cleaning and transformation
- **SQL**: Data structuring and querying
- **Power BI**: Data visualization and analysis
- **MS Access**: Database management

## Dataset Structure
The dataset (.CSV) was downloaded from the official IEC election results portal ([IEC](https://results.elections.org.za/home/Downloads/NPE-Results)). An MS Access database was created to organize data into tables, including Province, Municipality, VDistrict (Voting Districts), EResult (Election Results), PParty (Political Parties), and PVotes (Party Votes).

## Exploratory Analysis

- Among overseas voters, the DA received a significant **75.33%** of the votes, followed by the EFF with **4.40%** and the ANC with **3.92%**.
- Excluding votes from KwaZulu-Natal, the ANC would still not have achieved a majority, securing only **46.49%** of the vote.
- Gauteng emerged as the most competitive province, with at least four political parties (ANC, DA, EFF, M.K., and ActionSA) each receiving over **100,000** votes.
