# **South African Elections 2024 Data Analysis**
A data analysis project that transforms raw IEC (Independent Electoral Commission) election data into structured insights using Python, SQL, MS Access, and Power BI.
### The goal of this project was to visualize the 2024 national election data and conduct exploratory data analysis (EDA) to uncover trends, patterns, and insights.

## Tech Stack

- **Python**: Data cleaning and transformation
- **SQL**: Data structuring and querying
- **Power BI**: Data visualization and analysis
- **MS Access**: Database management
  
## Dataset Structure
I downloaded the (.CSV) file from the official IEC election results portal [IEC](https://results.elections.org.za/home/Downloads/NPE-Results) I then created an MS acces database consisting of Province, Municipality, VDistrict (Voting Districts), EResult (Election Results), PParty (Political Parties), PVotes (Party Votes)
